A Generic Distributed Auto-Tuning Framework. 

## Getting Started

### Installation

The uptune framework has python and C++ API bindings, and we install both by default. The C++ binding requires cmake (>2.8), gcc (>4.8.5) and GoogleTest to be installed. To install uptune, simply pull it back and run the install script with the following commands:

#### Install from Source 
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cornell-zhang/uptune.git; cd uptune
$ ./install.sh 
```
